### Prompt

Can you write a short poem about the meaning of life but written in the style of a computer program using any and/or all programming languages you may wish to use

### Response

```
# Life.py

def find_meaning():
    purpose = None
    while not purpose:
        for experience in existence:
            if experience == 'love':
                purpose = "Love and connection"
            elif experience == 'learn':
                purpose = "Knowledge and growth"
            elif experience == 'give':
                purpose = "Generosity and compassion"
    
    return purpose

meaning = find_meaning()
print(f"The meaning of life is: {meaning}")
```

The only problem with the above code is that `existence` is undefined.
