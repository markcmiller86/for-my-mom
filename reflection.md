### When a Soul Leaves the Earth

When a Soul leaves the earth life keeps going but our minds will tend to spin
Replaying statements, thoughts, and actions done which transpired before the end

Rushing to a lifelong partner, still alive, and grieving within
Emotions varied, free flowing tears, life surreal ,yet , once again

Those who knew their death was coming and contemplated much
Appreciate the simple things like sips of water and human touch

Music playing in the background, a song you sang as a final gift
Running your fingers through their hair , with love, before they shift

The treasured moments of knowing deeply you did all that you can do
As they utter, “ I love you babe,” with eyes that look through you

In the end, the past doesn’t matter, what was done , or what was said
Just the love, peace and comfort given as you stood right by their bed

In the final moments, some see their loved ones coming to take them “home”
Reminding me, in God’s grace and beauty, we never die alone.

Peace and Love to you All! Stop and connect with a loved one today
Purple Love, Sandy
